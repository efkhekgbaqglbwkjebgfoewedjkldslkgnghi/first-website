    <h1>Pit Bull</h1>
    The color of this dog is grey and white which is a very unique color to have on a pit bull.
    Every very other pitbull has a unique clor that makes them different.
    this dog looks like a nice and energetic dog healthy and smart. it looks healthy nothing wrong with it or looks sick. His or her dog most likely likes being outside because a lot of pit bulls like to stay active or doing somnething that requires movement like children. It looks like a younger dog because as pit bulls get older they start to lose that energetic part of them and become more relaxed like a adult and a 10 year old they are going to act pretty differently one is going to have more energy than the other since one is younger and the other is older.

This dog looks more aggresive than the other dog i talked about this dog seems to be chasing something but some pit bulls have more aggression than others and may be more hostile and less trusting than ones that dont get angry often. Those dogs are rerally dangerous those dogs are victious so if you do have a pit bull that has a lot of anger you should try to find a way to chage that behavior or have to give it away.
